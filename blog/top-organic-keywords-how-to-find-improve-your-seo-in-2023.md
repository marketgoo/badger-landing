## What are organic keywords?

Organic keywords are the search terms or phrases people use to find information, products, or services on search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. These keywords are considered "organic" because they do not result from paid advertising or sponsored content.

In other words, organic keywords are the words or phrases people naturally type into search engines when looking for something. For example, if someone is looking for an SEO reporting tool, you might use  "seo reporting tools" or "reporting tools for seo" or "why badger is the most important tool for seo reports".

## Why are organic keywords important for SEO?

Historically, organic keywords have been essential for SEO for several reasons:

* **Visibility:** Businesses and website owners can improve their visibility on search engines by targeting relevant organic keywords. When people search for those keywords, their website is more likely to appear on the first page of search results, increasing the chances of attracting clicks and traffic.
* **Relevance:** Organic keywords help businesses and website owners create content relevant to their target audience. By understanding what potential customers are searching for, they can create content that addresses their needs and interests and provide value to their audience.
* **Competition:** Organic keywords also help businesses and website owners stay competitive. By researching and targeting keywords their competitors use, businesses can improve their search engine rankings and attract potential customers searching for the same products or services.
* **Cost-effectiveness:** Unlike paid advertising, organic keywords are free to use. Google will always be your major source. 

## **Types of organic keywords**

* **Short-tail keywords:** Also known as head keywords, these are short and general keywords that contain one or two words. They typically have a high search volume but also high competition. Examples include "shoes" or "digital marketing".
* **Long-tail keywords** are longer and more specific phrases containing three or more words. They have a lower search volume but also lower competition. Examples include "black leather dress shoes for men" or "digital marketing agency in New York City".
* **Branded keywords:** These are keywords that include a brand name or a specific product or service associated with a brand. For example, "Nike shoes" or "McDonald's burgers".
* **Non-branded keywords** do not include any brand name or specific product or service associated with a brand. For example, "running shoes" or "fast food restaurants".
* **Product keywords:** These are specific to a product or service. For example, "blue suede shoes" or "content marketing services".
* **Informational keywords:** These are keywords that are used to find information on a particular topic. For example, "how to make sushi" or "history of Rome".
* **Transactional keywords:** These are keywords that indicate a user is ready to make a purchase or take a specific action. For example, "buy black leather dress shoes for men" or "sign up for a digital marketing course".

## ​​How to do keyword research in 2023?

First up, it's all about getting to know your audience. That means understanding their pain points, needs, and desires so you can create content that resonates with them. Once you have a good idea of your audience, it's time to build a list of keywords that will attract them to your site.

But don't just pull those keywords out of thin air! Use keyword frameworks to guide your research and ensure you're targeting the correct terms. These frameworks can include things like product features, benefits, pain points, and audience demographics.

Now that you have a solid list of keywords, it's time to analyze your competitors. Take a look at their content and see what keywords they're targeting. This can give you valuable insights into what's working in your industry and help you identify gaps in the market that you can fill.

But not all keywords are created equal, so it's essential to prioritize your list. Focus on the terms with the highest search volume, the lowest competition, and the most relevance to your business.

And finally, don't forget to use keyword research tools to help you refine your list and discover new opportunities. Plenty of great tools exist, like Google Keyword Planner and SEMrush.

## Analyzing competitor's keywords in 2023

1. Start by identifying your top competitors in the search results for your target keywords. Use SEMrush to analyze their website and identify the keywords they are ranking for. Look for patterns and trends in their keyword strategy, such as which keywords drive the most traffic or lead to high conversion rates.
2. Use this information to improve your own SEO strategy. Look for opportunities to create content that targets similar keywords but offers a unique perspective or added value to your pain points. You can also identify gaps in your competitor's content strategy and target keywords they may overlook.
3. It's important to note that simply targeting the exact keywords as your competitors are not enough to guarantee SEO success. You should always focus on creating high-quality, engaging content that provides value to your target audience.

## Identifying high-volume, low-competition keywords

Yup, identifying high-volume, low-competition keywords is still important in 2023 for SEO keyword research. These keywords can help a website rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).

But, while high-volume keywords have traditionally been the focus of SEO, the current market is saturated with competition. 

Exploring low-volume keywords can be a viable strategy for success. Although low-volume keywords may seem like the underdogs of SEO since fewer people search for them, they can still hold great potential for driving traffic and conversions to your website!

## Long-tail vs. short-tail keywords

Long-tail and short-tail keywords are still a thing in SEO in 2023. Still, the way they are used has evolved. Short-tail keywords are typically one or two words and have a higher search volume, making them more competitive to rank for. Long-tail keywords are longer phrases that are more specific and have a lower search volume but often have less competition.

In today's SEO landscape, a balanced approach is recommended. Short-tail keywords are still crucial for capturing overall search traffic, but long-tail keywords can provide valuable opportunities for niche targeting and higher conversion rates. It will always depend on your niche.

## Keyword mapping and organization

\
Once you have a list of keywords, you should categorize them based on relevance to different sections of your website or product categories.

1. **Assign Keywords to Pages:** Assign the target keywords to the pages on your website based on relevance and search intent. The home page should target broad keywords related to your business, while other pages should target more specific long-tail keywords.
2. **Optimize Published Content:** After assigning the keywords to the relevant pages, optimize the content accordingly. Include the target keyword in the page title, meta description, headings, and throughout the content naturally. What's stopping you from monitoring your content performance?
3. **Track and Refine:** Monitor your keyword performance regularly using tools like Google Search Console or other SEO analytics tools to see how well your pages rank for their target keywords. Adjust your keyword mapping and content as needed to improve rankings and traffic.

## Analyzing and tracking keyword performance with GA4

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) has arrived, bringing a wealth of valuable reports such as traffic acquisition and engagement rate. Here are some KPIs you can use: 

One of the newer metrics GA4 provides is **Engagement Rate,** which measures meaningful—engagements on your site, including clicks, scrolls, conversions, and more. By tracking engagement rate, you can gain insights into which pages or channels need improvement, whether on-page, page speed, or something else driving lower engagement. This information can help you identify and work on low-engagement pages falling below expectations.

GA4's **Enhanced Measurement** feature tracks conversion data as an event, providing granularity on user behavior that we didn't have "out of the box" with Universal Analytics (UA). With this feature, you can automatically track form interactions, starting with the form fill (form_start) and the form submission itself (form_submit). While automatic tracking can be too general in some cases, the form_start aspect is beneficial as it allows you to see drop-offs in the form-filling process. Monitoring metrics such as form interactions vs. form submissions can help with CRO by identifying potential issues with cumbersome forms or submit buttons.

The **Landing Page report i**n GA4 is a favorite among SEOs, where you can see which landing pages result in a conversion within the same session, making it perfect for identifying direct sales from SEO. Efforts. While it's important to track metrics that seem to need to be more obvious to give credit, the Landing Page report is a great starting point for SEO's contribution to conversion. It's worth noting that GA4 now provides a standard landing page report, so you don't have to customize your own report.
