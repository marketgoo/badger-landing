As an agency, your main goal is to help your clients succeed by driving more traffic, increasing conversions, and generating more revenue. However, it's essential to remember that your agency is also a business, and you need to invest time and effort in acquiring new organic leads.

Here are three hacks that SEO agencies most use to acquire organic leads:

## Create High-Quality Content

Creating high-quality content is the foundation of successful inbound marketing and essential for generating those organic leads. Producing engaging and informative content that resonates with your target audience can help build brand awareness and attract potential clients. This is the type of content that attracts visitors to your website, establishes your agency as a leader, builds **trust and authority** with potential clients, and drives conversions.

**Pro tip:** Inject humor into the content to create a powerful engagement.

When the business owner, the principal decision maker, and the company's president are willing not to take themselves too seriously and inject some humor into their content, it can create a fun and relatable image of their brand. This approach shows that the business understands its customers and wants to build a community with them.

Here are some key points for getting authoritative content that generates search traffic and builds clients' trust:

* Work with experienced writers who understand the Agency model and subject matter.
* Identify competitive gaps and unique angles.
* Consistently get high-quality content from a team of content marketers and strategists.
* Offer free resources, such as eBooks, whitepapers, and webinars, to help attract potential clients and generate leads.

## **Build Community** 

The game is not only about backlinks, which improve your website's credibility and increase its chances of ranking higher on SERPs. But the most beneficial milestone I've seen is building a relationship with somebody, building a community. It could be through social media, it could be just through a phone call, and it could be through a face-to-face visit. People value relationships, and that's the piece that's missing.

Building a community is not just a buzzword but a crucial aspect that SEO agencies must focus on. You want to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry or niche. So, invest in building a community, and you'll see the benefits in the long run.

## Consistency

Firstly, consistency builds **trust** (yup, we're back at trust again). When potential clients visit your website, they want to see that your agency is committed to providing quality content and good services. 

Secondly, consistency improves visibility. Search engines like Google reward websites that consistently produce high-quality content by ranking them higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). Regularly publish optimized content to improve your website's visibility, attract organic traffic, and generate more leads.

Lastly, consistency helps you stay on top of industry trends. SEO is an ever-changing landscape, and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices is essential to remain competitive. By consistently monitoring and adapting your SEO strategy, you can ensure that your agency stays ahead of the curve and continues to provide value to your clients. 

I know, ​as an agency, you're already juggling so many deliverables for your clients. Still, you also need to put 3 of these hacks in place to help your own agency improve in customer acquisition.
