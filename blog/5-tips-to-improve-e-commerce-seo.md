## Optimize product pages for SEO

Let's face it - the online marketplace is complex. With millions of online stores vying for attention, you must ensure your products stand out. That's where SEO comes in. Optimizing your product pages for relevant keywords and search terms will increase the chances of your pages appearing in search engine results pages (SERPs) when people search for those keywords.

And just like how a good makeover can make a big difference in how people perceive you, optimizing your product pages can make a big difference in how the search engines perceive your website. So, put on your SEO glasses and work on those product pages!

## Product cannibalization will destroy your SEO efforts

Keyword cannibalization - the silent killer of SEO efforts. It's like having multiple dogs fighting over the same scrap of food. Instead of working together to achieve a common goal, they fight for dominance. And when that happens, search engines get confused, and your rankings suffer.

So here's the deal: 

1. Make sure that your products have a clear distinction in terms of their features, pricing, and target audience. This will help to avoid confusion among customers and [minimize the likelihood of cannibalization.](https://rockcontent.com/blog/product-cannibalization/)
2.

3. Don't target the same keyword with a money page and blog post. You'll miss out on sales if the blog post ranks on page 1 and the money page is nowhere to be found. The website will target specific keywords and ensure each page has unique, high-quality content relevant to its intended keyword.
4. Use the [Table of Contents](https://getbadger.io/data-visualization-seo-seporting-guide/) when writing articles!
