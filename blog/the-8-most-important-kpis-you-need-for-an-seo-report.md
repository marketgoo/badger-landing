Measuring the performance of your SEO efforts is crucial. But with so many metrics to choose from, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. These KPIs can be easily tracked with Badger. Whether you're an agency, freelancer, or in-house marketer, this article will provide you with the essential KPIs you need to assess your SEO campaigns' success accurately. So, let's get started!

## Organic Traffic

This KPI measures the traffic that comes to your website from organic search results.

 A high number of sessions can indicate that your SEO efforts are driving more organic traffic to your site.

## **Bounce Rate**

This measures the percentage of visitors who leave your website after only visiting one page.

To view the bounce rate in Google Analytics, go to Acquisition>All Traffic>Channels. In the fourth column, you can see the overall bounce rate for each Channel (Organic, Paid, etc.).

## Pages per Session

This measures the average number of pages visitors view on your website during a session.

This metric can provide valuable insight into how engaged and interested your visitors are with your content and how well your website serves their needs.  A high number of pages per session value can indicate that your website is providing valuable and relevant content to your visitors and that they are exploring multiple pages on your site. This shows that your SEO efforts effectively drive relevant traffic to your site. 

To see this metric, go to **Acquisition>All Traffic>Channels.** 

## Average Page Load Time

This measures the average time visitors spend on your website during a session. By monitoring this metric, you can ensure that your site provides a good user experience, which is crucial for the success of your SEO campaigns.

## Impressions

This KPI measures the number of times your website appears in Google search results, regardless of whether the user clicks through to your site. This is simply a measure of your search visibility and will not impact your ROI. Still, it can help you evaluate the success of your SEO efforts and make informed decisions about where to focus your efforts in the future.

## Clicks

This KPI measures the number of clicks your website receives from Google search results. The more clicks your website receives, the more visible it is in search results, indicating that your SEO efforts have a positive impact. By tracking clicks over time, you can see trends and patterns in the performance of your website.

## Click-Through Rate (CTR)

This measures the ratio of clicks to impressions, indicating how effectively your website attracts clicks from Google search results. Is my CTR increasing or decreasing over time? How does my CTR compare to industry averages and benchmarks for my niche or industry? Do my meta descriptions and titles entice users to click through to my site? Ask these questions, and you'll better understand the factors affecting your CTR and identify areas for improvement in your SEO efforts.

## Keyword Rankings

This is the classic KPI that measures the position of your website in Google search results for specific keywords. This can be tracked using both tools, Semrush or Google Search Console.

Ranking well for important keywords is a critical part of any SEO campaign, as high keyword rankings will help drive more traffic to the website. 

To find your keywords go to **search results>keywords** or top organic keywords in case you have a connected Semrush account to Badger.
