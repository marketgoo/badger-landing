Hi there.

I am are super excited to announce that Badger is finally ready :)

As people who have worked in SEO for years, we lost track of the time we’ve spent preparing reports for clients. That’s why we created Badger.

We can't wait to **help you save tons of hours by automating reporting to your clients**.

We start humbly and will progress step by step. For example, we are working hard these days to release a fresh new integration with SEMRush.

Our vision is ambitious.

We see Badger becoming the go-to place for handling all your client digital marketing. From reporting to internal analysis, including auditing and client acquisition tools.

**Hope you join us and become part of this journey.**

So if would like to get started, just [click here](https://app.getbadger.io/) to access the first version of the product. 

By joining we invite you to co-create with us and collaborate on defining the future of the solution.

Thanks so much.

(One more thing: we’ve never liked it when companies push up their prices when they start to grow. That’s why **by signing up now we offer you lifetime pricing respect**.)
