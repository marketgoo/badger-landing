Hi there.

Our December cycle is finished and we are happy to share the new improvements in Badger.

We have been working hard during the past few weeks to have a first version of SEMRush integration in 2023. And we've done it ðŸŽ‰.

The SEMRush integration is providedÂ **out of the box**Â for all projects,Â **included in your subscription and without a need to have a SEMRush account.**Â

As requested by our first users weâ€™ll be adding valuable information from SEMRush, starting with the 10 best keywords for your clientâ€™s website. This is a great opportunity to showcase the work and results in your ongoing reports.

Also, **we have developed a new method to extract faster data form Google Analytics and Google Search Console**. Some users with big websites were experiencing during the onboarding long waiting times to have their dashboards ready, so we decided to prioritise improving this experience.Â 

Finally, we have fixed a few issues that were brought up during the beta testing phase of the product.

Go ahead and [try these new improvements](https://app.getbadger.io) for yourself.Â And don't hesitate to tell us what you think.

Thanks so much.

**David and the Badger team**
