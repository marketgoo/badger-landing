Great news! Badger has just released two new features that will make your SEO reporting experience even better.

First up, we've added the **custom logo feature.** 

Now you can add your logo to your reports and give them a personalized touch that will make your brand stand out. It's a great way to make your reports look more professional and impress your clients.

Secondly, you can now **reorder the blocks in your reports.**
