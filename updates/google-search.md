Recently we have added the Google Search Console connection to Badger. In this
first integration we only fetch the **search result** data, which includes the
number of clicks, impressions, CTR and keyword positions of the website grouped
by date, pages and keywords dimmensions.

Google Search Console doesn't provide only search result data but many other
interesting data like Discover, page indexing info, core web vitals etc. We are
planning to iterate over this connection anytime soon in order to allow you to
include this data in your reports. Stay tuned!
