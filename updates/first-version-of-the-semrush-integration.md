We have been working hard during the ending of 2022 to have a first version of Semrush integration in 2023. And we've done it ðŸŽ‰.

The Semrush integration is provided **out of the box** for all projects, **for free and without need to have a Semrush account.** We are using the API (updated every 15th day of the month) to extract some interesting info. And we wanted to start, in this first version, showing a table with the 10 best keywords. For now it is limited to only US results, but we want to include other countries coming soon.

Plese, let us know what do you think and which other info do you like to see in Badger.
