Hey there!

We are super excited to announce a new feature in Badger that we're sure you're going to love. 

We have just included **new date ranges in our graphs**. Now, beyond current and last month Badger lets you check data for **last 7, 15 and 30 days; and last 3, 6 and 12 months**.

With these new date ranges, you'll be able to dive deeper into your data and gain insights that you might have missed before.

This new feature is going to be a game-changer for all of our users who want to analyze their data over longer periods. A feature that was **highly requested** by the community.

Whether you're trying to identify seasonal trends, track long-term changes, or simply get a more comprehensive view of your data, these new date ranges will help you do it with ease. And the best part? It's all available with just a few clicks!

We understand the importance of having the right tools to help you make informed decisions, and we believe that these new date ranges will be a valuable addition to our already robust set of features.
